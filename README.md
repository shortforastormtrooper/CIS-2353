# CIS 2353-Data Structures

## Description
Students will investigate the programming techniques and theories involved in implementing linked lists, queues, stacks and tree structures. Recursion, searching techniques and sorting algorithms will also be considered. Students will be required to complete computer-based assignments inside/outside of class. 

## Course Outcomes
1. Describe the general structure and behavior of stacks, queues (including priority queues), linked lists, binary search trees, hash tables and heaps; 
2. Identify the most appropriate type of data structure to use for a given set of requirements; 
3. Describe performance issues related to each data structure (identified in objective 1) for basic operations such as insert, delete, and find; 
4. Demonstrate how to implement at least three data structures (identified in objective 1) using the Java Collections Framework; 
5. Demonstrate how to override the “toString” and “equals” methods of Java Collections classes and how to implement the Comparable interface; 
6. Demonstrate the ability to create structures within structures using the Java Collections Framework (e.g., a TreeMap of Linked Lists, ArrayList of ArrayLists); 
7. Identify three classic O(n log n) and three O(n2) sorting algorithms and describe their general properties;  
8. Illustrate the execution sequence of recursive methods
